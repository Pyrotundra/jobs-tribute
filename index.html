      <ul>
        <li><strong>Igniting the personal computer revolution</strong> -- With the Apple II and the Macintosh, Jobs and the then-named Apple Computer (AAPL) helped to launch the PC revolution.
        The Apple II, released in 1977, was one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers. The Macintosh,
        introduced in 1984, was the first commercially successful PC to use a mouse and graphical user interface.</li>
        <li><strong>Introducing the mouse and graphical user interface.</strong> -- Jobs changed how people interact with personal computers by replacing the text-based command-line interface with a
        mouse-driven graphical user interface. Instead of typing in commands with a keyboard, users could click on on-screen
        icons using a mouse controller. Jobs borrowed the idea for the new interface from Xerox 's (XRX) Palo Alto Research
        Center, which failed to see its potential.</li>
        <li><strong>Bringing portable music players to the masses.</strong> -- Others had come out with portable digital music players before Apple debuted the iPod in 2001. But Apple made the device
        a fun, simple and fashionable way to store thousands of songs. Jobs' creation soon dominated the market.</li>
        <li><strong>Revolutionizing the sale of music.</strong> -- Jobs turned music distribution on its head with the iTunes store by offering consumers an easy and affordable way to
        download songs to their computers and iPods. The iTunes store offered people an alternative to buying music CDs or
        illegally downloading songs from online sharing services.</li>
        <li><strong>Shepherding the age of computer animation.</strong> -- Jobs ushered in the age of feature-length computer-animated movies by funding and leading Pixar Animation Studios. Jobs
        bought an unproven animation studio from George Lucas in 1986 and turned it into a maker of blockbuster films, starting
        with "Toy Story" in 1995. Walt Disney (DIS) purchased Pixar in 2006 for $7.4 billion.</li>
        <li><strong>Opening Apple stores.</strong> -- Jobs defied the skeptics when he launched a chain of Apple retail stores starting in 2001. The stores have proved to be
        a huge success, not only in selling products but also extending the Apple brand and cachet worldwide. Apple now operates
        more than 350 stores.</li>
        <li><strong>Making personal computers stylish.</strong> -- From the start, Apple computers have stood out as stylish. From the candy-colored original iMacs to the superthin
        MacBook Air, Apple has made products that consumers crave. When it came to Apple's products, Jobs sweated the details of
        fit and finish.</li>
        <li><strong>Launching the smartphone revolution.</strong> -- When Jobs got Apple into the mobile phone business with the iPhone in 2007, he didn't just add cellular phone
        capabilities to an iPod or vice versa, as some expected. He came out with a landmark device that merged an iPod, full
        Internet browser and mobile phone into a beautiful gadget with a multitouch-screen interface. The iPhone was an instant
        hit and begat a thousand copycats.</li>
        <li><strong>Changing how software applications are distributed.</strong> -- Jobs changed how software applications are distributed when he opened the App Store for downloading applications to the
        iPhone and iPod Touch in 2008. He gave developers a way to write and sell mobile programs to consumers online. Its
        success created a vibrant ecosystem that has boosted demand for Apple's mobile devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Kicking off the tablet trend.</strong> -- Apple faced a lot of doubters when Jobs debuted the iPad tablet in April 2010. But the media tablet soon became another
        hit product.</li>
